GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
It is same as like subversion (svn) on which you can do version controlling on the projects.

Working with git may be a challanging task because using git using commang or gui's comes with some more complexities
When ever you work with command line their is some different way of working with the repository and the local repository
When you work with egit plugin of eclipse their will be a different approach 
This may also cause that ur tested code will be gone forever with the two techniques without any question.......huhh...!!

So work like this....
Their are three faces in git
1. Working copy
2. Stagging Server
3. Remote Server(Github Repository)

Using Command line their can be git bash u can work with....seeing their scinerios over bash is very easy
But with other plugins their is some time their internal working behind these faces.

Inside GitBash
git init --- will initiate the current existing folder as the repository.
git add filename
git add .
git commit -a -m "message"
git status After every command will show you the right path to ....what you need to do
git push origin master --- this will push the code to the remote server..
git pull will pull data from the remote repository
